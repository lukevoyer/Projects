There are 3561 observed female Lovoo users who are looking for a straight relationship, 21 looking for a bisexual relationship, and 366 who are just looking for friends. The average amount of photos per profile can range from 3 to 6 photos on average, with 21 year olds posting the most, to 26 year olds posting the least. Lastly, this investigation shows that surprisingly, that those who don't have bio's on their profiles actually get more views than those who do.\n",
